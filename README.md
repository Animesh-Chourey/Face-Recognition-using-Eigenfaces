# Face Recognition using Eigenfaces

Here the task is on learning models of human faces for recognition. In particular, Eigenface based recognition is performed here.

Following things have been executed in this project:
* Mean image and the covariance matrix of the training image set is constructed.
* Eigenface of the training set is computed.
* First 20 eigenfaces having the first 20 largest eigenvalues have been represented by the eigenvectors.
* The distance from the project test images to the projected training images is computed.
* The recognition rate using 20 Eigenfaces is computed.
